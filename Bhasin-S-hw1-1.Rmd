## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

#7 I think we need to use the ggplot2 function to create this graph. Before I do this, I need to eliminate the errors I am getting in the previous codes. 


#8 I think we dropped it since there were replciates when we merged the dataset

#9 The beneficiary is not making a profit since they are charging the expect value of the cost. 

#10 It has been very challenging to work with this data. I think getting the tables was a learnign experience since you had to make sure R knew exactly what data to put where. Also, it was aggervating when the errors would come, then I would try to fix them and they would keep occuring.
