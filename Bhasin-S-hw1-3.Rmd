#Question 1 

There are `r format(tot.obs, big.mark=",")` observations in the data set, which means there are that many different combinations of contracts, plans, countries, and years in the data set. 

\vspace{.2in}

#Question 2

There are `r nrow(plan.type.table)` different plan_types in the data. One of them is "NA" so there are 26 different plan_types in data set. 

# Question 3 

```{r plantype1, echo=F, eval=T, render = lemon_print}
#3

plan.type.year1

```

# Question 4

```{r plantype2, echo=F, eval=T, render = lemon_print}

plan.type.year2
```


#Question 5

```{r avgenrollment,echo=FALSE, include=T, eval=T, fig.cap="Average Enrollments per County", fig.width=4}

fig.avg.enrollment
```





#Question 6

```{r echo=FALSE}

final.data3

```


#Question 7


```{r echo=FALSE}
final_data2
```
# Question 8 

We dropped the “800-series” plans because they are offered by employers and union group sponsors. Therefore, they mostly represent Employer Group Wavier Plans, not Medicare. 

#Question 9 

So many plans charge a 0 dollar premium because government funding helps the insurance companies offer Medicare plans with no premiums. Most people qualify for premium-free Part A, so they have a 0 dollar premium, whereas Part B has a premium. For the beneficiary, it means that they do not have to pay a monthly cost for medicare if they stick to Plan A, which does not include some doctors’ services, outpatient care, medical supplies, and preventive services unlike Plan B. 

#Question 10 

My experience working with these data sets were very challenging. I learned how to create graphs in R as well as the importance of being patient. Several things aggravated me but trying to figure out how to get the R markdown was a struggle. 


## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r }

```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
